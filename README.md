# es-function-modifiers (control flow)

Prototypal and non-prototypal implementations of possibly desirable JavaScript/ECMAScript function/method-modifiers
which allow the interception, introspection and manipulation of a function's/method's control flow in terms of its
arguments, return value and context at such a modified function's/method's call/apply/execution time.
